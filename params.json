In the rules file, each device manufacturer is identified by a unique vendor ID, as specified by the ATTR{idVendor} property. \r\n  \r\nFor more infomation,please visit<BR />     [http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html](http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html).                 \r\n[http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids](http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids)\r\n\r\n##System requirements\r\nUbuntu,Fedora or other linux systems.\r\n\r\n##Install  \r\n1.Open the console to copy the file \"51-android.rules\" to \"**/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules**\" by executing the command below. To Achieve it，you should be sure that you have the **root** permission.\r\n```bash\r\nsudo curl --create-dirs -L -o /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules -O -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snowdream/51-android/master/51-android.rules\r\n```\r\n2.To give it appropriate permissions next execute the command:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo chmod a+r /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules\r\n```\r\n3.Then execute：\r\n```bash\r\nsudo service udev restart\r\n```\r\n\r\n4.When plugged in over USB, can verify that your device is connected by executing `adb devices` from your SDK platform-tools/ directory. If connected, you'll see the device name listed as a \"device.\"\r\n\r\n##License\r\n```\r\nCopyright (C) 2014 Snowdream Mobile <yanghui1986527@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n        http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
